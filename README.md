# WishSorter

### Currently does not work!

- This is a program to help sort the prices on wish (https://wish.com)
- This is not a finished product. (Please check the TODO-list)
- <s>**This only works for the Norwegian crown (NOK) (Please make an issue on this git if you want your own currency to work with this program)**</s>
- Do not worry, this program will not (NEVER!) buy any item on wish using your credentials.
- If you find any problems with this program not listed in the TODO-list, please make an issue on this git, thank you :)
- This program can be very slow if it is to process many items, so hang on tight if it takes a long time.

# TODO-list

- <s>Get currency dynamically for all users</s>
- <s>Get pictures of items in an imagelist to be shown</s>
- Make program independent of a webbrowser control (HTTPRequest)
- Make saving credentials locally a thing
- Improve performance (by amount of RAM it uses)
- Check when search result does not yield any more results
