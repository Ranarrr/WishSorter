# WishSorter

- This is a program to help sort the prices in wish (https://wish.com)
- This is not a finished product. (Please check the TODO-list)
- **This only works for the Norwegian crown (NOK) (Please make an issue on this git if you want your own currency to work with this program)**
- Do not worry, this program will not (NEVER!) buy any item on wish using your credentials.

# TODO-list

- Get currency dynamically for all users
- Get pictures of items in an imagelist to be shown
- Make program independent of a webbrowser control (HTTPRequest)
- Make saving credentials locally a thing
